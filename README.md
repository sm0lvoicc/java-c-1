# Java
okay so, let me get straight to the point, Java is a pure/ture OOP (object oriented programming) language, it can be used for Android apps and stuff, one of thr biggest examples of popular java apps among kids is Minecraft. I am bad at introduction, so lets get straight to important stuff
## Setting up stuff
now, to start with java you will need
#### 1. Code editor/IDE
now, there are many code editors out there, like, Visual Studio code, the one with S, Atom, and others, and IDEs for java are NetBeans (i don't really like this, tbh, i hate it), and IntelliJ (the best IDE for java)  
Now its all upto you, i personally use inetlliJ for big projects and Visual Studio Code for small stuff, i really like the UI of VSC and everything except the complexicity of intelliJ
#### 2. JDK
short for Java Development Kit, idts i need to explain this

## Writing the first program
now whatever place to wrte java you have installed, start a new java project in it, and then in the `src` make a file named `helloWorld.java` and write the [code](https://github.com/sm0lvoicc/java-c-1/blob/main/helloWorld.java) in it
